# Closure and Decorators

# Closure

1. What is it?

- access to variables/functions/classes from out of actual scope

2. How to create?

- we need have min 2 function, outer and inner
- outer function have to return declaration of inner function
- inner function have to use something from outer function like variables, functions, classes

3. Pros:

- persistence

4. Cons:
   -leak of memory

## Scope - access/visibility to variable/function declaration, class definition

- LEGB

1. L - local, created by function body
2. E - enclosing, function object '__closure__'
3. G - global, created by module (python file)
4. B - built-in, examples: sum, max, print, len...

## 2 ways of finding identifier:

1. LHS - left-hand side assignment - check if variable exists locally, if not- create it
2. RHS - right-hand side assignment - search through the scopes (LEGB)

## 2 basic data structure

1. Stack - FILO - first in, last out
2. Queue - FIFO - first in, first out

## List indexing

"a" | "b" | "c"
--- | --- | ---
0 | 1 | 2
-3 | -2 | -1

# Programming main rules:

- DRY - don't repeat yourself
- KISS - keep it simple, stupid!

## Higher order function

- function, which declaration of function as parameter

## First class function

- all functions are objects

# Decorators:

## 3 variance

- function decorator 
- class decorator
- design pattern (the best way to solve problem)

## How to create: 
1. Create function using closure
2. Ad annotation with at and name of decorator above decorated function
